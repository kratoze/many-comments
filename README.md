# many-comments

Front end for Many Comments (find the backend here https://github.com/kratoze/many-comments-api)

A Reddit-ish clone that allows a user to make posts, comment on posts, comment on comments, and upvote/downvote posts and comments.

Bootstrapped with create-react-app and uses React and Redux.

This project was started so I can become more familiar with Redux, MongoDB and APIs.
