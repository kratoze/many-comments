Front end for Many Comments

A Reddit-ish clone that allows a user to make posts, comment on posts, comment on comments, and upvote/downvote posts and comments.

Bootstrapped with create-react-app and uses React and Redux.

This project was started so I can become more familiar with Redux, MongoDB and APIs.
